# Overview

This project was intended to help me gain a better understanding of working principles of GIS Mapping by creating and adding layers to a mapping system to gain a visual understanding of some of the abilities GIS has that can be utilized In showing information.

The software is designed to be a map of the Nampa Idaho area and displays some of the homes for sale as a green dot. A person can select a dot and a pop-up screen will appear with information about the home, as well as an image of what the home looks like. The user can zoom in and zoom out as well as switch from home to home.

A heat map provides a better understanding of where affordable housing is compared to higher priced housing. This is designed to help the user gain, a better understanding of what areas are affordable and reasonable to live in. The housing data was collected from Zillow.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
To develop the software I used a variety of resources, including ArcGIS JavaScript Tutorials and W3schools for JavaScript, I also used YouTube tutorials to better understand how to run ArcGIS.

I used VS code as my primary platform writing in HTML and JavaScript using ArcGIS for displaying and creating visuals for the map and heat map, as well as a JavaScript API from ArcGIS.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to gain a better understanding of how to connect Maps created in ArcGIS with elements created in my HTML.
* I want to make the application more interactive and provide more options, such as a calculator to help estimate payment costs associated with the property. 
* I want to edit the heat map to Be more descriptive, and easier to understand. 
* I feel that the program appears jumbled, and could use revisiting and rearranging for effectiveness.
